While Gatekeeper is primarily designed to work with Kubernetes, you can run the core component, Open Policy Agent (OPA), using Docker Compose. However, note that you won't get the full Gatekeeper experience with Kubernetes-specific features, such as validating and mutating admission controls.

To deploy OPA using Docker Compose, you can create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.7'
services:
  opa:
    image: openpolicyagent/opa:latest
    ports:
      - "8181:8181"
    command:
      - "run"
      - "--server"
      - "--log-level=info"
```

This configuration will run the OPA server, exposing it on port 8181.

To deploy the OPA service using this configuration, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can now interact with the OPA REST API on `http://localhost:8181`.

Keep in mind that this setup only deploys the OPA service and not the full Gatekeeper functionality. You'll need to manage policies and interact with OPA directly using the API or CLI. For more information about OPA and how to use it, consult the official OPA documentation: https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/
