You're right; I missed adding the `myresolver` settings in the `traefik.yml` configuration. Apologies for the confusion. You need to add a `certResolver` configuration for Traefik to use the certificates from the file system.

Here's the updated `traefik.yml` configuration file, including the `myresolver` settings:

```bash
certificatesResolvers:
  myresolver:
    file:
      filename: "/path/to/certificates.yml"
```

```bash

# You need to create a separate file (`certificates.yml` for YAML or `certificates.toml` for TOML) and provide its path in the `filename` field. This file will store the configuration for the `myresolver` certResolver.

# In the `certificates.yml` file, add the following:

tls:
  certificates:
    - certFile: /etc/letsencrypt/live/registry.example.com/fullchain.pem
      keyFile: /etc/letsencrypt/live/registry.example.com/privkey.pem
```

These configurations define the `myresolver` certResolver, which Traefik will use to load the certificates from the file system. Make sure to replace `registry.example.com` with your actual domain name and update the path to the certificates as needed.

Don't forget to restart Traefik after updating the configurations.
