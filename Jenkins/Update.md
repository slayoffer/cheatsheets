> In this short tutorial we will apply minor update to existing Jenkins installation on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine.

Common location of jenkins war file on ubuntu server is:

```
/usr/share/jenkins
```

## Update the installation

Jump to jenkins home directory

```
cd /usr/share/jenkins
```

Stop the jenkins server

```
sudo service jenkins stop
```

Move existing jenkins war file

```
sudo mv jenkins.war jenkins.war.old
```

Download latest jenkins war file

```
sudo wget https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/latest/jenkins.war
```

Start the Jenkins server

```
sudo service jenkins start
```

Everything should be good now.

## Troubleshooting steps

If you are running jenkins using root permissions, (which you should not be doing), you need to change the jenkins.war permissions.

```
$ sudo chown root:root jenkins.war
```

You can optionally restart the jenkins server using below command:

```
$ sudo /etc/init.d/jenkins restart
```

If you are not able to find jenkins war file in standard path, you can goto Manage Jenkins â†’ System Information, it will display the path to the .war file.

On ubuntu, you can also try the below two commands to update everything:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```

As per jenkins official wiki: https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+on+Ubuntu

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install jenkins
```
