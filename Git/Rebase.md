### Case

```bash
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint:
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge (the default strategy)
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint:
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
```

Manually resolving a large number of merge conflicts can be tedious. Here are a few strategies to help speed up this process next time:

1. **Pull Frequently**: One of the best ways to minimize merge conflicts is by integrating changes frequently. If you're working on a feature branch for a long time without integrating the changes from the master branch, you're more likely to have merge conflicts.

2. **Use `git pull origin master --rebase`**: Rather than merging, consider using rebase. When you rebase, your changes are "replayed" on top of the changes from master. If you have a clean commit history on your feature branch, this can sometimes be a cleaner way to incorporate changes from master.

3. **Use the `ours` or `theirs` Strategy During Merge**: If you know that you want to accept all changes from one side, you can use the `-Xours` or `-Xtheirs` option with `git merge`. This will automatically resolve all conflicts in favor of one side.
    - `git merge -Xours master` will automatically resolve all conflicts in favor of your branch.
    - `git merge -Xtheirs master` will automatically resolve all conflicts in favor of the master branch.

4. **Resolve All Conflicts in Favor of The Incoming Changes**: If you always want to accept the incoming changes, you can use the checkout command to quickly resolve conflicts.
    - `git checkout --theirs .` will resolve all merge conflicts for all files in favor of the incoming changes.
    - `git checkout --ours .` will resolve all merge conflicts for all files in favor of the current changes.

5. **Work with Smaller, More Frequent Commits and Merges**: If you're finding that you frequently have large merge conflicts, it could be a sign that your feature branches are living too long or your commits are too large. Consider committing smaller units of work and merging more frequently.

Remember, good communication with your team can also help prevent merge conflicts. If team members are aware of who is working on what, they can avoid modifying the same code at the same time. Regularly pulling from master to get the latest changes can also help prevent conflicts.
