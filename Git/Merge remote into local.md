To merge a remote branch named "rc" into your local branch named "devops," you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the latest changes from the remote repository by fetching the latest updates:
```
git fetch
```

2. Switch to your "devops" branch:
```
git checkout devops
```

3. Merge the "rc" branch into your "devops" branch using the `git merge` command:
```
git merge origin/rc
```
Here, "origin/rc" refers to the remote branch named "rc."

4. Git will attempt to automatically merge the changes from the "rc" branch into your "devops" branch. If there are any conflicts, you will be prompted to resolve them manually. Open the conflicted files, resolve the conflicts, and save the changes.

5. After resolving any conflicts, commit the merge changes:
```
git commit -m "Merge remote branch 'rc' into devops"
```
Provide an appropriate commit message that describes the merge operation.

6. Finally, push the merged changes to the remote repository:
```
git push origin devops
```

By following these steps, the changes from the "rc" branch will be merged into your "devops" branch, and the merged branch will be pushed to the remote repository.
