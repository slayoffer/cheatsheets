If you disconnect from the shell during the Ubuntu release upgrade process, the upgrade may be interrupted and result in an incomplete or broken system. In such a scenario, you could encounter problems like missing packages, incorrect configurations, or a system that doesn't boot.

So better make screen session beforehand

```bash
screen -S my_screen
```

To recover from a disconnected session during the upgrade process, follow these steps:

1.  Reconnect to the system and try to resume the upgrade process. If the upgrade process was running inside a `screen` or `tmux` session, you might be able to reattach to the session and resume the upgrade.

```bash
# For screen 
screen -r

# For tmux 
tmux attach
```

2.  If you can't resume the upgrade process, you might need to repair the system manually:

-   Update the package lists:

`sudo apt-get update`

-   Fix broken or missing packages and dependencies:

`sudo apt-get install -f`

-   Upgrade and configure any remaining packages:

`sudo dpkg --configure -a sudo apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`

-   Ensure all required packages for the new release are installed:

`sudo apt-get --fix-missing install ubuntu-desktop`

Replace `ubuntu-desktop` with your specific Ubuntu flavor, like `kubuntu-desktop` or `xubuntu-desktop`, if necessary.

-   Clean up any unnecessary packages:

`sudo apt-get autoremove sudo apt-get autoclean`

3.  Once you've completed these steps, reboot the system:

`sudo reboot`

After the system reboots, check if the upgrade was successful and if the system is working correctly. If you still encounter issues, you may need to perform further troubleshooting or consider a fresh installation of the new Ubuntu release.
