## Head and tail to show part of text files

If you only want to see certain parts of the text file in cat-styled display, use the head and tail commands.

By default, the head command displays the first 10 lines of a file.

```
head filename
```

But you can modify it to show the first n lines as well.

```
head -n filename
```

The tail command displays the last 10 lines by default.

```
tail filename
```

But you can modify it to show n lines from the bottom.

```
tail -n filename
```

### Practice examples

Let's see some examples. Generate an easy-to-follow file using this script:

```
#create or clear the content of the file
echo -n > sample

#put content to the file
for i in {1..70}
do
  echo "This is the line $i" >> sample
done
```

Create a new file named script.sh and copy-paste the above script content into it. Now run the script like this to generate your sample file:

```
bash script.sh
```

Now, you have got a file named `sample` that contains lines like "This is the line number N" for every 70 lines.

Display the first 10 and the last 10 lines of this sample file.

Let's take it to the next level. You can combine them both to show specific lines of a file. For example, to show lines from 35 to 40, use it like this:

```
head -n 40 filename | tail -n +35
```

Here:

- `head -n 40 filename` will display the first 40 lines of the file.
- `tail -n +35` will display the lines from the 35th line to the end of the output from the `head` command. Yeah! Mind the + sign that changes the normal behavior of the tail command.

You can also combine them to show only a particular line. Let's say you want to display the 55th line; combine head and tail like this.

```
head -n 55 filename | tail -n 1
```

Here:

- `head -n 55 filename` will display the first 55 lines of the file.
- `tail -n 1` will display the last line of the output from the `head` command, which will be the 55th line of the file.
