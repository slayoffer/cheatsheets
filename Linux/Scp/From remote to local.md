Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) is a useful tool that you can use to transfer files between two different systems. The following example will guide you through the process of using SCP to copy a file from another server to your current server:

The general command syntax is as follows:

```bash
scp [options] [user@]host:source target
```

- **options** - Here you can specify additional flags like `-r` for recursive copying (in case of directories) or `-P` for specifying a port other than the default SSH port (22).
- **user** - This is the username of the account on the remote host.
- **host** - This is the hostname or IP address of the remote host.
- **source** - This is the path to the file or directory that you want to copy on the remote host.
- **target** - This is the path on the local machine where you want to copy the file or directory to.

So if you wanted to copy a file named `myfile.txt` from the home directory of a user named `myuser` on a remote host at `192.168.1.1` to the local directory `/home/localuser/`, the command would look something like this:

```bash
scp slayo@10.0.0.2:/home/slayo/plexmediaserver_1.32.4.7195-7c8f9d3b6_amd64.deb /root
```

This will prompt you to enter the password for `myuser` on the remote host. Once you have entered the password, the file will begin to transfer.

Please note, in order to use SCP, you will need SSH access to the remote system.
