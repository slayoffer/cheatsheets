## CLI mode

> CLI mode is made to be integrated in your command lines workflow.

You can perform a single run:

```
yo list all processes listening on port 8080
```

You can ask for a command line generation, enforcingÂ `ðŸš€ exec`Â prompt mode usage withÂ `-e`:

```
yo -e show the disk usage of my docker resources
```

You can ask any question, enforcingÂ `ðŸ’¬ chat`Â prompt mode usage withÂ `-c`:

```
yo -c generate me a go application example using fiber
```

You can alsoÂ `pipe`Â input that will be taken into account in your request:

```
cat some_script.go | yo -c generate unit tests
```

Or even:

```
cat error.log | yo -c explain what is wrong here
```

## REPL mode

> REPL mode is made to work in an interactive way.

Just run:

```
yo
```

This will open aÂ [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)Â interface, with 2 types of prompts (useÂ `tab`Â to switch)

-   `ðŸš€ exec`: will generate a command line to execute for what youâ€™re asking
-   `ðŸ’¬ chat`: will engage in a discussion to help you the best way possible

You also can use the followingÂ **keyboard shortcuts**:

-   `â†‘`Â `â†“`Â : Navigate in history
-   `tab`Â : Switch betweenÂ `ðŸš€ exec`Â andÂ `ðŸ’¬ chat`Â prompt modes
-   `ctrl+h`Â : Show help
-   `ctrl+s`Â : Edit settings
-   `ctrl+r`Â : Clear terminal and reset discussion history
-   `ctrl+l`Â : Clear terminal but keep discussion history
-   `ctrl+c`Â : Exit or interrupt command execution
