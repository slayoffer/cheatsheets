## CLI mode

> CLI mode is made to be integrated in your command lines workflow.

You can perform a single run:

```
yo list all processes listening on port 8080
```

You can ask for a command line generation, enforcing `🚀 exec` prompt mode usage with `-e`:

```
yo -e show the disk usage of my docker resources
```

You can ask any question, enforcing `💬 chat` prompt mode usage with `-c`:

```
yo -c generate me a go application example using fiber
```

You can also `pipe` input that will be taken into account in your request:

```
cat some_script.go | yo -c generate unit tests
```

Or even:

```
cat error.log | yo -c explain what is wrong here
```

## REPL mode

> REPL mode is made to work in an interactive way.

Just run:

```
yo
```

This will open a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) interface, with 2 types of prompts (use `tab` to switch)

-   `🚀 exec`: will generate a command line to execute for what you’re asking
-   `💬 chat`: will engage in a discussion to help you the best way possible

You also can use the following **keyboard shortcuts**:

-   `↑` `↓` : Navigate in history
-   `tab` : Switch between `🚀 exec` and `💬 chat` prompt modes
-   `ctrl+h` : Show help
-   `ctrl+s` : Edit settings
-   `ctrl+r` : Clear terminal and reset discussion history
-   `ctrl+l` : Clear terminal but keep discussion history
-   `ctrl+c` : Exit or interrupt command execution
