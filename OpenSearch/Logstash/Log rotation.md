To set up Logstash OSS (Open Source) to apply an OpenSearch index policy when creating new indices, you need to follow these steps:

1. Install and configure OpenSearch and Logstash:

Make sure you have OpenSearch and Logstash installed and running. For detailed instructions on installation and configuration, refer to the official documentation:

- OpenSearch: https://opensearch.org/docs/opensearch/install/index/
- Logstash: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/getting-started-with-logstash.html

2. Create an OpenSearch index policy:

Create an index policy in OpenSearch that specifies the required settings and actions to be taken on the indices. You can either create a new index policy or use an existing one. For detailed instructions, refer to the OpenSearch documentation:

- Creating an index policy: https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/im-plugin/ism/policies/#create-policy

3. Configure Logstash output:

In your Logstash configuration file (usually located at `/etc/logstash/conf.d` or `/usr/share/logstash/pipeline`), configure the output to connect to your OpenSearch cluster and set the `template` and `ilm_enabled` parameters. Here's an example:

```
output {
  opensearch {
    hosts => ["<your_opensearch_host>:<your_opensearch_port>"]
    index => "your_index_name-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
    user => "<your_opensearch_username>"
    password => "<your_opensearch_password>"
    template => "./your_template_file.json"
    template_name => "your_template_name"
    ilm_enabled => "true"
    ilm_rollover_alias => "your_alias_name"
    ilm_pattern => "000001"
    ilm_policy => "your_policy_name"
  }
}
```

Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values for your setup.

4. Create the index template:

In the same directory as your Logstash configuration file, create a JSON file (referenced in the `template` parameter above) that defines your index template, which will include the mapping, settings, and the alias to be applied to the new indices. Make sure to specify the `opendistro.index_state_management.policy_id` setting to apply your index policy. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "index_patterns": ["your_index_name-*"],
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "number_of_replicas": 1,
    "opendistro.index_state_management.policy_id": "your_policy_name"
  },
  "mappings": {
    "_source": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "properties": {
      "@timestamp": {
        "type": "date"
      },
      "@version": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "your_field": {
        "type": "keyword"
      }
    }
  },
  "aliases": {
    "your_alias_name": {}
  }
}
```

Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values for your setup.

5. Start or restart Logstash:

Start or restart Logstash to apply the changes. Logstash will create new indices with the specified settings and apply the index policy from OpenSearch.

By following these steps, Logstash OSS will apply the OpenSearch index policy when creating new indices.

ILM stands for Index Lifecycle Management. It is a feature available in Elasticsearch (and OpenSearch) that allows you to automate the management of your indices throughout their lifecycle. This includes creating, updating, and deleting indices as they grow, age, and meet certain conditions or criteria.

ILM is designed to help you optimize the performance, cost, and manageability of your Elasticsearch or OpenSearch clusters. It allows you to define policies that consist of various actions and conditions, such as:

- Rollover: Move to a new index when the current index reaches a certain size or age.
- Shrink: Reduce the number of shards in an index to save resources.
- Force merge: Merge segments in an index to improve query performance and reduce storage space.
- Freeze: Make an index read-only and reduce its resource consumption when it is no longer being updated.
- Delete: Remove an index when it is no longer needed.

These actions can be performed automatically based on the policies you define, making it easier to manage indices as they evolve over time. ILM is particularly useful for time-series data, such as logs and metrics, where data is continuously generated and tends to lose relevance over time.

In the context of Logstash, you can enable ILM to ensure that the indices it creates are managed according to the policies you have defined in Elasticsearch or OpenSearch. This simplifies index management and allows you to optimize storage and performance as your data grows and ages.
