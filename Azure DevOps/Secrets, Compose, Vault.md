Azure DevOps supports Docker Compose for orchestrating multi-container Docker applications. To use secrets in Docker Compose with Azure DevOps, you can use the Azure Key Vault.

Here are the general steps you can follow:

1. Create an Azure Key Vault in your Azure subscription.
2. Add secrets to the Azure Key Vault.
3. Grant your Azure DevOps service principal access to the Azure Key Vault.
4. Reference the secrets in your Docker Compose file.

To reference the secrets in your Docker Compose file, you can use the `secrets` keyword followed by the name of the secret in the Azure Key Vault. Here's an example:

```
yamlCopy codeversion: '3.7'

services:
  web:
    image: myapp
    secrets:
      - mysecret

secrets:
  mysecret:
    external:
      name: mykeyvaultsecret
```

In this example, the `web` service has a secret named `mysecret` that is retrieved from the Azure Key Vault secret named `mykeyvaultsecret`.

Note that you'll need to make sure that the Azure Key Vault is accessible from the Docker Compose environment where your application is running. You can do this by either setting the `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AZURE_TENANT_ID` environment variables in your Docker Compose file, or by using the Azure CLI to authenticate to your subscription.

Here's a more detailed example of a Docker Compose file that uses secrets from an Azure Key Vault:

```
yamlCopy codeversion: '3.7'

services:
  web:
    image: myapp
    environment:
      - MY_SECRET=${MY_SECRET}
    secrets:
      - mysecret

secrets:
  mysecret:
    external:
      name: mykeyvaultsecret
```

In this example, we have a service named `web` that uses the `myapp` Docker image. The `web` service has an environment variable named `MY_SECRET` that is set to the value of the `mysecret` secret. The `secrets` section defines the `mysecret` secret as an external secret that is retrieved from the Azure Key Vault secret named `mykeyvaultsecret`.

To use this Docker Compose file with Azure DevOps, you'll need to define the `MY_SECRET` environment variable in your Azure DevOps pipeline, and grant your Azure DevOps service principal access to the Azure Key Vault.

Here's an example of how you can define the `MY_SECRET` environment variable in your Azure DevOps pipeline:

```
variables:
  MY_SECRET: $(mykeyvaultsecret)
```

In this example, the `MY_SECRET` variable is set to the value of the `mykeyvaultsecret` secret in the Azure Key Vault.

You'll also need to grant your Azure DevOps service principal access to the Azure Key Vault. You can do this by adding the `Azure Key Vault` task to your pipeline and configuring it with the appropriate settings.

Once you've defined the environment variable and granted access to the Azure Key Vault, you can run your Docker Compose file with the `docker-compose` command in your Azure DevOps pipeline.
