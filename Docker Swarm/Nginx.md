To configure Nginx as a load balancer for a Docker Swarm web service, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a Docker network for the web service and the Nginx container to communicate. For example:

   ```bash
   docker network create my-network
   ```

2. Deploy your web service to the Docker Swarm cluster, specifying the network you just created:

   ```bash
   docker service create --name my-web-service --network my-network my-image
   ```

3. Deploy an Nginx container as a global service on the same network. The Nginx container will act as a load balancer for the web service:

   ```bash
   docker service create --name my-nginx --network my-network --mode global nginx
   ```

4. Configure the Nginx container to route requests to the web service. You can do this by creating an Nginx configuration file on the Swarm manager node:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /var/lib/docker/volumes/my-nginx-conf/_data/nginx.conf
   ```

   Replace `/var/lib/docker/volumes/my-nginx-conf` with the path to a volume that you create to store the Nginx configuration file.

   In the Nginx configuration file, add a `server` block to define the upstream servers for the web service:

   ```bash
   http {
       upstream my-web-service {
           server my-web-service:80;
       }
   
       server {
           listen 80;
           server_name mydomain.com;
           location / {
               proxy_pass http://my-web-service;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace `my-web-service` with the name of your web service, and `mydomain.com` with the domain name you want to use.

5. Mount the Nginx configuration file into the Nginx container using a Docker volume:

   ```bash
   docker service update --mount-add type=bind,source=/var/lib/docker/volumes/my-nginx-conf/_data/nginx.conf,target=/etc/nginx/nginx.conf my-nginx
   ```

   Replace `/var/lib/docker/volumes/my-nginx-conf/_data/nginx.conf` with the path to the Nginx configuration file on the Swarm manager node.

6. Verify that the web service is working by accessing the domain name you specified in your web browser. Nginx should load balance requests to the web service containers in the Swarm cluster.

Note: This is a basic configuration example, and you may need to modify it to suit your specific needs. Also, make sure to secure your Nginx configuration by enabling HTTPS and adding authentication as needed.
