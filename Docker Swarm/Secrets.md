#### Creating a Secret

To create a secret, we need to first initialize Docker Swarm. You can do so using the following command:

```bash
docker swarm init
```

Once the service is initialized, we can use the `docker secret create` command to create the secret:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N "" -f mykey

docker secret create my_key mykey

rm mykey
```

In these commands, we first create an SSH key using the `ssh-keygen` command and write it to `mykey`. Then, we use the Docker secret command to generate the secret. Ensure you delete the `mykey` file to avoid any security risks.

You can use the following command to confirm the secret is created successfully:

```bash
docker secret ls
```
  
We can now use this secret in our Docker containers. One way is to pass this secret with `–secret` flag when creating a service:

```bash
docker service create --name mongodb --secret my_mongodb_secret redis:latest
```
