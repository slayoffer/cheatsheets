If you want to use the Nexus npm registry inside your Dockerfile, you can create an `.npmrc` file with the necessary configuration and add it to your Docker image. Here's how to do it:

1. Create an `.npmrc` file in your project:

   Create a new file in your project directory called `.npmrc.template` with the following contents:

   ```
   //${NEXUS_REGISTRY_HOST}/:_authToken=${NEXUS_AUTH_TOKEN}
   registry=https://${NEXUS_REGISTRY_HOST}/
   always-auth=true
   ```

   This file will be used to create the actual `.npmrc` file with the correct credentials during the Docker build process.

2. Update your Dockerfile:

   Modify your Dockerfile to include the following steps:

   - Copy the `.npmrc.template` file into the Docker image.
   - Replace the placeholders with the actual Nexus registry credentials.
   - Run npm commands using the configured registry.
   - Remove the `.npmrc` file with credentials after it's no longer needed.

   Here's an example of how to do this in your Dockerfile:

   ```
   # Use the official Node.js image as your base image
   FROM node:14

   # Set your working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy your package.json and package-lock.json files
   COPY package*.json ./

   # Copy the .npmrc.template file
   COPY .npmrc.template .npmrc

   # Replace the placeholders with the actual Nexus registry credentials
   ARG NEXUS_REGISTRY_HOST
   ARG NEXUS_AUTH_TOKEN
   RUN sed -i "s/\${NEXUS_REGISTRY_HOST}/${NEXUS_REGISTRY_HOST}/g" .npmrc && \
       sed -i "s/\${NEXUS_AUTH_TOKEN}/${NEXUS_AUTH_TOKEN}/g" .npmrc

   # Install your npm dependencies using the configured registry
   RUN npm ci

   # Copy the rest of your application code
   COPY . .

   # Build your application, if necessary
   RUN npm run build

   # Remove the .npmrc file with credentials
   RUN rm -f .npmrc

   # Expose the application port and start the application
   EXPOSE 3000
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

3. Build your Docker image:

   When building your Docker image, pass the Nexus registry credentials as build arguments:

   ```
   docker build --build-arg NEXUS_REGISTRY_HOST=my-nexus-instance.com --build-arg NEXUS_AUTH_TOKEN=my-auth-token -t my-image .
   ```

   Replace `my-nexus-instance.com` with your Nexus registry URL, `my-auth-token` with your Nexus authentication token, and `my-image` with your desired Docker image name.

With these changes, your Dockerfile will use the Nexus npm registry to install dependencies during the image build process. The `.npmrc` file with the credentials will be removed from the final Docker image to prevent exposing sensitive information.

The `NEXUS_AUTH_TOKEN` is a Base64-encoded representation of your Nexus username and password, in the format `username:password`. To obtain the `NEXUS_AUTH_TOKEN`, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the credentials (username and password) for your Nexus Repository Manager.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and use the following command to generate the `NEXUS_AUTH_TOKEN`:

   ```
   echo -n "username:password" | base64
   ```

   Replace `username` and `password` with your actual Nexus username and password.

3. The output will be a Base64-encoded string, which is your `NEXUS_AUTH_TOKEN`. Copy this token and use it in your Azure DevOps pipeline or Docker build process.

Remember that the `NEXUS_AUTH_TOKEN` should be treated as a sensitive value, and it's recommended to store it as a secret variable in your Azure DevOps pipeline or any other CI/CD tool you are using.

To build a Docker image with your Nexus npm registry using Azure DevOps, follow these steps:

1. Configure your Nexus npm registry and obtain the credentials, as mentioned in the previous answers.

2. Store credentials in Azure DevOps, as described in the previous answer. For this scenario, you need to store the following variables: `NEXUS_REGISTRY_HOST`, `NEXUS_AUTH_TOKEN`.

3. Create or update your `azure-pipelines.yml` file:

   Add a new job to your pipeline to build and push the Docker image. Make sure you have the Docker extension installed in your Azure DevOps instance. Update your `azure-pipelines.yml` file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
     branches:
       include:
       - main

   pool:
     vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

   variables:
     imageName: 'your-image-name'

   steps:
   - task: Docker@2
     displayName: 'Build and Push Docker image'
     inputs:
       containerRegistry: 'your-container-registry-service-connection'
       repository: '$(imageName)'
       command: 'buildAndPush'
       Dockerfile: '**/Dockerfile'
       buildContext: '.'
       buildArgs: 'NEXUS_REGISTRY_HOST=$(NEXUS_REGISTRY_HOST),NEXUS_AUTH_TOKEN=$(NEXUS_AUTH_TOKEN)'
   ```

   Replace `your-image-name` with the desired name for your Docker image, and `your-container-registry-service-connection` with the name of your container registry service connection (e.g., Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, etc.).

4. Create a Container Registry Service Connection:

   If you haven't already, create a service connection in Azure DevOps for your container registry. This allows Azure DevOps to authenticate with your container registry and push the built Docker images.

   - Go to your Azure DevOps project.
   - Click on "Project Settings" in the bottom left corner.
   - Under "Pipelines," select "Service connections."
   - Click "New service connection" and choose the type of your container registry (e.g., Docker Registry, Azure Container Registry).
   - Fill in the required information and click "Save."

With this setup, Azure DevOps will build the Docker image using your Nexus npm registry and push the image to your specified container registry when the pipeline is triggered.
