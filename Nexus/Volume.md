Yes, it is possible to create a separate volume for Docker in Nexus. Docker images and layers can consume a lot of disk space, so it's a good idea to store them on a separate volume to avoid running out of space on the volume where Nexus stores its artifacts.



Here's how you can create a separate volume for Docker in Nexus:



1. Create a new directory for Docker data. You can create this directory anywhere on your file system. For example, you could create a directory called `nexus-data/docker`:

   ```
   mkdir -p /path/to/nexus-data/docker
   ```

2. Mount the new directory as a volume in your Docker container. You can do this by adding a volume mount to your Docker run command:

   ```
   docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus -v /path/to/nexus-data:/nexus-data -v /path/to/nexus-data/docker:/docker sonatype/nexus3
   ```

   This command mounts the `nexus-data` directory as a volume at `/nexus-data` inside the container, and the `nexus-data/docker` directory as a volume at `/docker` inside the container.

3. Configure Nexus to use the new Docker volume. In the Nexus web UI, go to `Administration` > `Repositories` > `docker (hosted)` > `Configuration` and set the `Blob store path` to `/docker`.



With these steps, Nexus will store Docker images and layers in the `nexus-data/docker` directory on your file system, which is mounted as a volume inside the Docker container. This ensures that Docker data is stored separately from Nexus artifacts, which helps avoid disk space issues.
